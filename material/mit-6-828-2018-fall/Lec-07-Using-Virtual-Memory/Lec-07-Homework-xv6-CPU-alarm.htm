<h1>Homework: xv6 CPU alarm</h1>

<p>Submit your solutions before the beginning of the next lecture to the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2018/handin.py/">submission web site</a>.

</p><p>
In this exercise you'll add a feature to xv6 that periodically alerts
a process as it uses CPU time. This might be useful for compute-bound
processes that want to limit how much CPU time they chew up, or for
processes that want to compute but also want to take some periodic
action. More generally, you'll be implementing a primitive form of
user-level interrupt/fault handlers; you could use something similar
to handle page faults in the application, for example.

</p><p>
You should add a new <tt>alarm(interval, handler)</tt> system call.
If an application calls <tt>alarm(n, fn)</tt>, then after every
<tt>n</tt> "ticks" of CPU time that the program consumes, the kernel
will cause application function
<tt>fn</tt> to be called. When <tt>fn</tt> returns, the application
will resume where it left off. A tick is a fairly arbitrary unit of
time in xv6, determined by how often a hardware timer generates
interrupts.

</p><p>
You should put the following example program in <tt>alarmtest.c</tt>:

</p><pre>#include "types.h"
#include "stat.h"
#include "user.h"

void periodic();

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int i;
  printf(1, "alarmtest starting\n");
  alarm(10, periodic);
  for(i = 0; i &lt; 25*500000; i++){
    if((i % 250000) == 0)
      write(2, ".", 1);
  }
  exit();
}

void
periodic()
{
  printf(1, "alarm!\n");
}
</pre>

The program calls <tt>alarm(10, periodic)</tt> to ask the kernel to
force a call to <tt>periodic()</tt> every 10 ticks, and then spins for
a while.
After you have implemented the <tt>alarm()</tt> system call in the kernel,
<tt>alarmtest</tt> should produce output like this:

<pre>$ alarmtest
alarmtest starting
.....alarm!
....alarm!
.....alarm!
......alarm!
.....alarm!
....alarm!
....alarm!
......alarm!
.....alarm!
...alarm!
...$ 
</pre>
<p>

</p><p>
(If you only see one "alarm!", try increasing the number of iterations in
<tt>alarmtest.c</tt> by 10x.)

</p><p>
Hint: you'll need to modify the Makefile to cause <tt>alarmtest.c</tt>
to be compiled as an xv6 user program.

</p><p>
Hint: the right declaration to put in <tt>user.h</tt> is:
</p><pre>    int alarm(int ticks, void (*handler)());
</pre>

<p>
Hint: You will also have to update <tt>syscall.h</tt> and <tt>usys.S</tt> to
allow <tt>alarmtest</tt> to invoke the alarm system call.

</p><p>
Hint: Your <tt>sys_alarm()</tt> should store the alarm interval and the
pointer to the handler function in new fields in the <tt>proc</tt>
structure; see <tt>proc.h</tt>.

</p><p>
Hint: here's a <tt>sys_alarm()</tt> for free:
</p><pre>    int
    sys_alarm(void)
    {
      int ticks;
      void (*handler)();

      if(argint(0, &amp;ticks) &lt; 0)
        return -1;
      if(argptr(1, (char**)&amp;handler, 1) &lt; 0)
        return -1;
      myproc()-&gt;alarmticks = ticks;
      myproc()-&gt;alarmhandler = handler;
      return 0;
    }
</pre>
Add it to <tt>syscall.c</tt> and add an entry for <tt>SYS_ALARM</tt>
to the <tt>syscalls</tt> array in that file.

<p>
Hint: You'll need to keep track of how many ticks have passed since
the last call
(or are left until the next call) to a process's alarm handler;
you'll need a new field in <tt>struct&nbsp;proc</tt> for this too.
You can initialize <tt>proc</tt> fields in <tt>allocproc()</tt>
in <tt>proc.c</tt>.

</p><p>
Hint: Every tick, the hardware clock forces an interrupt, which
is handled in <tt>trap()</tt> by <tt>case&nbsp;T_IRQ0&nbsp;+&nbsp;IRQ_TIMER</tt>;
you should add some code here.

</p><p>
Hint: You only want to manipulate a process's alarm ticks if there's a
process running and if the timer interrupt came from user space;
you want something like
</p><pre>    if(myproc() != 0 &amp;&amp; (tf-&gt;cs &amp; 3) == 3) ...
</pre>

<p>
Hint: In your <tt>IRQ_TIMER</tt> code, when a process's alarm interval
expires, you'll want to cause it to execute its handler. How can you
do that?

</p><p>
Hint: You need to arrange things so that, when the handler returns,
the process resumes executing where it left off. How can you do that?

</p><p>
Hint: You can see the assembly code for the alarmtest program in alarmtest.asm.

</p><p>
Hint: It will be easier to look at traps with gdb if you tell qemu to use
only one CPU, which you can do by running
</p><pre>    make CPUS=1 qemu
</pre>

<p>
It's OK if your solution doesn't save the caller-saved user registers
when calling the handler.

</p><p>
Optional challenges: 1) Save and restore the caller-saved user registers around the
call to handler. 2) Prevent re-entrant calls to the handler -- if a handler
hasn't returned yet, don't call it again. 3) Assuming your code doesn't
check that <tt>tf-&gt;esp</tt> is valid, implement a security attack on the
kernel that exploits your alarm handler calling code.
