<h1>CSE 120 Nachos Project Guide</h1>
<div class="h1sub">Spring 2018</div>

<h2>Nachos</h2>

<p> Nachos is an instructional operating system for undergraduate OS
classes. It is a challenging system to learn, but is also as rewarding
as it is challenging.

<p> Nachos may seem complex (it is) and confusing at first, but after
using the system for a while you will become familiar and comfortable
with it. There are also some advantages with using such a
well-established project. First, it has been thoroughly debugged and
is therefore relatively stable. Second, there is extensive
documentation describing the Nachos system. Both of these aspects
should make it easier for you to learn and use Nachos.

<p> During the quarter we will be starting with a pre-project and then
doing three substantial projects:
  
<ol start=0>
<li><a href="project0.html">Introduction</a> (1%)</li>
<li><a href="project1.html">Threads</a> (33%)</li>
<li><a href="project2.html">Processes and Multiprogramming</a> (33%)</li>
<li><a href="project3.html">Virtual Memory</a> (33%)</li>
</ol>

<p> The project grade is evenly split among the projects (each is 33%
  of the project grade), and project 0 is the remaining 1%.

<!--
<p>It is this outline that we will be following for our projects this quarter.</p>
-->

<!--
<p>There are two versions of Nachos in current use, Nachos 3.4 and Nachos 4.0. They both have the same functionality. Nachos 4.0 is an updated version of 3.4, has been more widely ported, and is perhaps better architected from a software engineering point of view. However, most of the detailed guides describing the Nachos system refer to Nachos 3.4. Because of this reason, we will be using Nachos 3.4.</p>
-->

<h2>Groups</h2>

<!--
<p><strong>Due</strong>: <span class="due">Friday, October 10, at noon</span>
  -->

<p> You will work on projects 1&ndash;3 in groups of 1&ndash;3
  students.  Project 0 is a short, individual project, and we will
  overlap forming groups with project 0.  You can form groups with
  students across both lecture sections.

<!--
<p> When you have formed a group, please send mail
to <a href="mailto:h8liu@cs.ucsd.edu">Lonnie</a>
(<tt>h8liu@cs.ucsd.edu</tt>) with your names and your account logins
(i.e., the account name you use to login to ieng6).  We will use your
logins for creating Unix groups.  If you are seeking other group
members, you can post to Piazza or send mail to the list.  If you
would like to be placed into a group, send mail to Lonnie and he will
create groups out of students also asking to be placed into a group.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p> There are a number of sources for using and learning the Nachos
system, starting with the source code itself.

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp18/cse120-a/projects/nachos-cse120-sp18.tar.gz">Nachos source</a>
<li> <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp08/Nachos/walk/">Nachos Walkthrough</a>
<li> <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp08/Nachos/doc/index.html">Nachos API</a>
<li> The original <a href="nachos.pdf">Nachos paper</a> (note that it
  describes the original Nachos project developed in C++)
</ul>

<p> The platform we will officially support is Linux/x86 on the
  machines in the CSE B230&ndash;B270 labs and the ieng6 ACMS server
  cluster.  We have customized the generic Nachos distribution for the
  CSE 120 class, so you should use the version of Nachos that we make
  available (i.e., do not download from other sites on the Web).  If
  you would like to work with Nachos on another system, see the
  discussion of <a href="crosscompile.html">cross-compilation</a> for
  projects 2 and 3.

<!--
The Nachos distribution file can be found on <a href="https://github.com/h8liu/nachos">github</a>. </p>
-->

<!--
<p>To compile the code and have a test run, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/h8liu/nachos.git
$ cd nachos/code
$ make
$ cd threads
$ ./nachos
</code></pre>

<p>It will create and populate the directory <code>nachos</code>.</p>
-->

<h2>
<a name="user-content-git" class="anchor" href="#git" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git</h2>

<p>Starting with project 1, we will be using Git for version control in CSE 120.
The Git site has <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">an excellent
reference manual online</a>.  We will provide more details when we start project 1.

<h2>Adding Source Code</h2>

<p> Your project code will be automatically graded.  There are two
reasons for this:

  <ol>
    <li>A grader program can test your code a lot more thoroughly and
        consistently than a TA can, yielding more consistent results.
    <li>A grader program can test your code a lot faster than a TA can.
  </ol>

<p> Of course, there is a tradeoff.  Everything that will be tested
needs to have a standard interface that the grader can use, leaving
slightly less room for you to be creative.  Your code must strictly
follow these interfaces (the documented <tt><i>*</i>Interface</tt>
classes).

<p> Since your submissions will be processed by a program, there are
some very important things you must do, as well as things you must not
do. For <i>all</i> of the projects in this course:

  <ol>
    <li><i>Do not</i> modify <tt>Makefile</tt>, <b>except</b> in the
      test directory for projects 2 and 3.  When grading, we will be
      using our own Makefile (<tt>javac</tt> automatically finds
      source files to compile, so we do not need you to submit
      a <tt>Makefile</tt>).</li>

    <li>Only modify <tt>nachos.conf</tt> according to the project
      specifications.  When grading, we will also being using our
      own <tt>nachos.conf</tt> file.  Do not rely on any additional
      keys being in this file.</li>

    <li><i>Do not</i> modify any classes in
      the <tt>nachos.machine</tt> package, the <tt>nachos.ag</tt>
      package, or the <tt>nachos.security</tt> package. Also do not
      add any classes to these packages, as they would not be used
      during grading.</li>

    <li><i>Do not</i> add any new packages to your project.
      All the classes you submit must reside in the packages we provide.</li>

    <li><i>Do not</i> modify the API for methods that the grader
      uses. This constraint is enforced every time you run Nachos
      by <tt>Machine.checkUserClasses</tt>.  If an assertion fails
      there, you will know you have modified an interface that needs
      to stay the way it was given to you.</li>

    <li><i>Do not</i> directly use Java native threads
      (the <tt>java.lang.Thread</tt> class).  The Nachos security
      manager will not permit it.  All the threads you use should be
      managed by TCB objects (see the documentation for
      <tt>nachos.machine.TCB</tt>).</li>

    <li><i>Do not</i> use the <tt>synchronized</tt> keyword in any of
      your code. We will <tt>grep</tt> for it and reject any submission
      that contains it.</li>

    <li><i>Do not</i> directly use Java <tt>File</tt> objects (in the
      <tt>java.io</tt> package). In later projects, when we start
      dealing with files, you will use a Nachos file system
      layer.</li>

    <li>Sprinkled throughout the Nachos classes there are some calls
      to the Nachos autograder.  Leave them as they are.

  </ol>

  <!--
<p> When you want to add non-java source files to your project, simply
add entries to your <tt>Makefile</tt>.
-->

<p>
During each project, we will provide a program that you can use to
submit your code to the autograding system.  As a result, you will be
able to make sure that your code compiles and runs with the autograder
well before you submit it.

<h2>Assistance</h2>

<p> The Nachos projects are aggressive, complex, and time-consuming.
Nachos may seem overwhelming at first, but the projects are not
impossible.  If your group is spending many hours stuck on a single
problem, then you should seek assistance.  Be sure and read the
various support documents.  Come to office hours.  Talk to the TAs and
tutors in the lab.  And use Piazza the class discussion board to share
problems and tips.

<h2>
<a name="cheating" class="anchor" href="#cheating" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cheating</h2>

<p>Cheating is not an acceptable method for completing your projects. The consequences of cheating will correspond to the severity, but most often lead to failure of the course. The <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/%7Eelkan/honesty.html">academic honesty guidelines</a> outlined by Charles Elkan for CSE 130 apply to this course.</p>

<p>
I urge you to resist any temptation to cheat, no matter how desperate
the situation may seem.  If you are in circumstances that you feel
compel you to cheat, come to me first before you do so.
