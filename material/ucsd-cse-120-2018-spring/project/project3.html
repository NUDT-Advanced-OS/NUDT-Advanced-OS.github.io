<h1>Project 3: Demand Paging</h1>
<div class="h1sub">Spring 2018</div>

<p><strong>Due</strong>: <span class="due">Friday, June 8 at 11:59pm</span> (No extensions) (Really)</p>

<p> In project 2, each process had a page table that was initialized
  with physical pages and their contents when the process was created.
  In project 3, you will be implementing a more sophisticated memory
  management system where physical pages are allocated on demand and
  pages that cannot fit in physical memory will be stored on
  disk. </p>

<!--

<p> The operating system kernel works together with the machine's
  memory management unit (MMU) to support virtual memory.
  Coordination between the hardware and software centers on the page
  table structure for each process.  You used page tables in project 2
  to allow your kernel to assign any free page frame to any process
  page, while preserving the illusion of a contiguous virtual memory
  for the process.  The indirect memory addressing through page tables
  also isolates each process from bugs in other processes that are
  running concurrently.

-->  

<h2>Background</h2>

<p> You will implement and debug virtual memory in two steps.  First,
  you will implement demand paging using page faults to dynamically
  initialize process virtual pages on demand, rather than initializing
  page frames for each process in advance at <tt>exec</tt> time as you
  did in project 2.  Next, you will implement page replacement,
  enabling your kernel to evict a virtual page from memory to free up
  a physical page frame to satisfy a page fault.  Demand paging and
  page replacement together allow your kernel to "overbook" memory by
  executing more processes than would fit in machine memory at any one
  time, using page faults to multiplex the available physical page
  frames among the larger number of process virtual pages.  When
  implemented correctly, virtual memory is undetectable to user
  programs unless they monitor their own performance. </p>

<p> You project will implement the following functionality: </p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Demand Paging</b>. Pages will be in physical memory only as
    needed.  When no physical pages are free, it is necessary to free
    pages, possibly evicting pages to swap. </li>

  <li><b>Lazy Loading</b>. To fulfill the spirit of demand paging,
    processes should load no pages when started, and depend on demand
    paging to provide even the first instruction they execute.  When
    you are done, <tt>loadSections</tt> will not allocate even a
    single page. </li>

  <li><b>Page Pinning</b>. At times it will be necessary to "pin" a
    page in memory, making it temporarily impossible to evict. </li>
</ol>

<p> The changes you make to Nachos will be in these two files in
the <tt>vm</tt> directory:

<ul>
<li><tt>VMKernel.java</tt> &mdash; an extension of UserKernel
<li><tt>VMProcess.java</tt> &mdash; an extension of UserProcess
</ul>

<p> You will notice that these classes inherit
  from <tt>UserKernel</tt> and <tt>UserProcess</tt>.  Try to depend on
  the implementation of your base classes as much as possible.  Note
  that, with <tt>readVirtualMemory</tt>
  and <tt>writeVirtualMemory</tt>, very little code needs to know the
  details of virtual addressing.  For example, you should not have to
  change any of the primary code which serviced the <tt>read</tt>
  syscall.  That said, you should not change the base classes in any
  way that makes them dependent on project 3.  It should still be
  possible to run <tt>nachos</tt> from the <tt>proj2</tt> subdirectory
  to run user-level programs. </p>

<p> You will compile and run the project in the <tt>proj3</tt>
  directory.  Unlike the first two projects, you will not need to
  learn any new Nachos modules and will continue to use functionality
  that you became familiar with in project 2.  Before starting your
  implementation, also see the <a href="#tips">Tips</a> section
  below. </p>

<h2>Design Aspects</h2>

<p> Central to this project are the following design aspects:

<p>
<ol> 

<li><b>TranslationEntry bits.</b>  You will extend your kernel's
  handling of the page tables to use three special bits in each
  TranslationEntry (TE): </p>

<ul>

  <li> Valid bit: Nachos will set or clear the valid bit in each TE to
    tell the CPU which virtual pages are resident in memory (a valid
    translation) and which are not resident (an invalid translation).
    If a user process references an address for which the TE is marked
    invalid, then the CPU raises a page fault exception and transfers
    control to the Nachos exception handler. </li>

  <li> Used bit: The CPU sets the used bit (aka reference bit) in the
    TE to pass information to Nachos about page access patterns.  If a
    virtual page is referenced by a process, the machine sets the
    corresponding TE reference bit to inform the kernel that the page
    is active.  Once set, the reference bit remains set until the
    kernel clears it. </li>

  <li> Dirty bit: The CPU sets the dirty bit in the TE whenever a
    process executes a store (write) to the corresponding virtual
    page.  This step informs the kernel that the page is dirty; if the
    kernel evicts the page from memory, then it must first "clean" the
    page by writing its contents to disk.  Once set, the dirty bit
    remains set until the kernel clears it. </li>
</ul>

</li>

<p></p>
<li><b>Swap File.</b>  To manage swapped out pages on disk, use
  the <tt>StubFileSystem</tt> (via <tt>ThreadedKernel.fileSystem</tt>)
  as in project 2.  There are many design choices, but we suggest
  using a single, global swap file across all processes.  This file
  should last the lifetime of your kernel, and be properly deleted
  upon Nachos termination.  Be sure to choose a reasonably unique file
  name.

  <p> When designing the swap file, keep in mind that the units of
    swap are pages.  Thus you should try to conserve disk space using
    the same techniques applied in virtual memory: if you end up
    having gaps in your swap space (which will necessarily occur with
    a global swap file upon program termination), try to fill them.
    As with physical memory in project 2, a global free list works
    well.  You can assume that the swap file can grow arbitrarily, and
    that there should not be any read/write errors.  Assert if there
    are. </p>

</li>

<p></p>
<li><b>Global Memory Accounting.</b> 

  In addition to tracking free pages (which may be managed as in
  project 2), there are now two additional pieces of memory
  information of relevance to all processes: which pages are pinned,
  and which process owns which pages.  The former is necessary to
  prevent the eviction of certain "sensitive" pages.  The latter is
  necessary to managing eviction of pages.

  There are many approaches to solving this problem, but we
  suggest using a global inverted page table (see
  the <a href="#tips">tips</a> below).</p>

</li>

<p></p>
<li><b>Page Pinning.</b>  When your code is using a physical page for
  system calls (e.g., in <tt>readVirtualMemory</tt>
  or <tt>writeVirtualMemory</tt>) or I/O (e.g., reading from
  the <tt>COFF</tt> file or the swap file), you will need to "pin" the
  physical page while you are using it.  Consider the following
  actions:

<p>
<ol>

<li>Process A is executing the program at user-level and invokes
the <tt>read</tt> system call. </li>

<li> Process A enters the kernel, and is part way through writing to
user memory. </li>

<li> A timer interrupt triggers a context switch, entering process B. </li>

<li> Process B immediately generates numerous page faults, which in
turn cause pages to be evicted from other processes, including some
used by process A. </li>

<li> Eventually, process A is scheduled to run again, and continues
handling the <tt>read</tt> syscall as before.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p> In this example, the page to which A is writing should be pinned
  in memory so that it is not chosen for page eviction.  Otherwise, if
  process B evicted the page, then when process A was rescheduled it
  would accidentally write over the page B loaded.  Just use another
  data structure to keep track of which pages are pinned. </p>

</ol>
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p> 1. (30%) Implement demand paging.  In this first part, you will
  continue to preallocate a physical page frame for each virtual page
  of each newly created process at <tt>exec</tt> time, just as in
  project 2.  And as before, for now continue to return an error from
  the <tt>exec</tt> system call if there are not enough free page
  frames to hold the process' new address space.  You will not yet
  need to implement the swap file, page replacement, page pinning, an
  inverted page table, etc.  Instead, you just need to make the
  following changes: </p>

<ol>

  <li> In <tt>VMProcess.loadSections</tt>, initialize all of the
    TranslationEntries as <b>invalid</b>.  This will cause the machine
    to trigger a page fault exception when the process accesses a
    page.  Also do not initialize the page by, e.g., loading from
    the <tt>COFF</tt> file.  Instead, you will do this on demand when
    the process causes a page fault.  As a
    result, <tt>loadSections</tt> will continue to allocate physical
    page frames in the page table for each virtual page, but delay
    loading the frames with content until they are actually referenced
    by the process.

    <p></p>
  <li> Handle page fault exceptions
    in <tt>VMProcess.handleException</tt>.  When the process
    references an invalid page, the machine will raise a page fault
    exception (if a page is marked valid, no fault is
    generated).  Modify your exception handler to catch this exception
    and handle it by preparing the requested page on demand.

    <p></p>
  <li> Add a method to prepare the requested page on demand.  Note
    that faults on different pages are handled in different ways.  A
    fault on a code page should read the corresponding code page from
    the <tt>COFF</tt> file, a fault on a data page should read the
    corresponding data page from the
    <tt>COFF</tt> file, and a fault on a stack page or arguments page
    should zero-fill the frame.

    <p> For this step, for reference look at the <tt>COFF</tt> file
      loading code from <tt>UserProcess.loadSections</tt> from project
      2.  If the process faults on page 0, for example, then load the
      first page of code from the executable file into it.  More
      generally, when you handle a page fault you will use the value
      of the faulting address to determine how to initialize that
      page: if the faulting address is in the code segment, then you
      will be loading a code page; if the address is in the data
      segment, then load the appropriate data page; if it is any other
      page, zero-fill it.  It is fine to loop through the sections of
      the <tt>COFF</tt> file until you find the approprate section and
      page to use (assuming it is in the <tt>COFF</tt> file).  </p>

      <!--
If you did the process argument extra credit in project 2, the process will fault on these pages when the child writes the arguments to its address space (using WriteMem) when the child thread first starts running in the Nachos kernel and before the program starts running. Handling these argument pages is optional for this project.
-->

    <p> Once you have paged in the faulted page, mark the
    TranslationEntry as <b>valid</b>.  Then let the machine restart
    execution of the user program at the faulting instruction: return
    from the exception, but do not increment the PC (as is done when
    handling a system call) so that the machine will re-execute the
    faulting instruction.  If you set up the page (by initializing it)
    and page table (by setting the valid bit) correctly, then the
    instruction will execute correctly and the process will continue
    on its way, none the wiser. </p>

  <li> Update <tt>readVirtualMemory</tt>
    and <tt>writeVirtualMemory</tt> to handle invalid pages and page
    faults.  Both methods directly access physical memory to
    read/write data between user-level virtual address spaces and the
    Nachos kernel.  These methods will now need to check to see if the
    virtual page is valid.  If it is valid, it can use the physical
    page as before.  If the page is not valid, then it will need to
    fault the page in as with any other page fault.

  </li>

</ol>

<p><b>Testing:</b> As long as there is enough physical memory to fully
  load a program, then you should be able to use test programs from
  project 2 to test this part of project 3.  See the tips in
  the <a href="#testing">Testing</a> section below for how you can
  control (increase or decrease) the number of physical pages
  (e.g., <tt>write10</tt> is going to need more than the default of 16
  pages).  If you give Nachos enough physical pages, you can even run
  the <tt>swap4</tt> and <tt>swap5</tt> tests (and these tests do not
  use any system calls other than <tt>exit</tt>).

<p> 2. (70%) Now implement demand paged virtual memory with page
  replacement.  In this second part, not only do you delay
  initializing pages, but now you delay the allocation of physical
  page frames until a process actually references a virtual page that
  is not already loaded in memory. </p>

    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li> In part one for <tt>VMProcess.loadSections</tt>, you
	allocated physical pages for each virtual page, but you marked
	them as invalid so that they would be initialized on a page
	fault.  Now change <tt>VMProcess.loadSections</tt> so that it
	does not even allocate a physical page.  Instead, merely mark
	all the TranslationEntries as invalid. </li>

      <p></p>
      <li> Extend your page fault exception handler to allocate a page
	frame on-the-fly when a page fault occurs. In part one, you
	just initialized the contents of the virtual page when a page
	fault occurred.  In this part, now allocate a physical page
	for the virtual page and use your code from part 1 above to
	initialize it, mark the TranslationEntry as valid, and return
	from the exception.

    </ol>

    <p> You can get the above two changes working without having page
      replacement implemented for the case where you run a single
      program that does not consume all of physical memory.  Before
      moving on, be sure that the two changes above work for a single
      program that fits into memory. </p>

    <p> Now implement page replacement to free up a physical page
    frame to handle page faults: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Extend your page fault exception handler to evict pages
	once physical memory becomes full. First, you will need to
	select a victim page to evict from memory.

	Your page eviction strategy should be the clock algorithm.
<!--

	(bears the name "second-chance algorithm" in the text). Note that
  you also have enough information to implement the text's "enhanced
  second-chance algorithm" if you so desire.  <br />

-->
	
	Then mark the TranslationEntry
	for that page as invalid.

	<p></p>
      <li> Evict the victim page. If the page is clean (i.e., not
	dirty), then the page can be used immediately; you can always
	recover the contents of the page from disk. If the page is
	dirty, though, the kernel must save the page contents in
	the swap file on disk.

	<p></p>
      <li> Read in the contents of the faulted page either from the
	executable file or from swap (see below).

	<p></p>
      <li> Implement the swap file for storing pages evicted from
	physical memory.  You will want to implement methods to create
	a swap file, write pages from memory to swap (for page out),
	read from swap to memory (for page in), etc.

    </ol>

    <p> As you implement the above operations, keep the following
    points in mind: </p>

    <ul>
      <li> As in the first part of the project, the first time a page
	is touched it needs to be initialized (e.g., from the
	executable file for code and data).  If this page is
	subsequently evicted to swap, it will be read from there on
	further page faults. To be concrete, consider a page used for
	data. On the first access (fault) on that page, you will read
	that page in from the executable file.  Assume the process
	dirties the page.  When this page gets evicted, you should
	write it to the swap.  If the process faults on the page
	again, you should read the page in from the swap, not from the
	executable file (the executable file contains the initial
	version of the page, the swap contains the most recent version
	of the page). </li>

      <!--
You are not limited to one file for backing store for the entire system, and you can have a separate backing store file for each process. Doing so makes locating evicted pages convenient (virtual page n in the address space will be stored at offset n * PageSize in the file), and you can allocate a backing store object for each AddrSpace and store it in a field in AddrSpace. However, do not create backing store files at finer granularities; e.g., do not use one file per page.

      Be sure to set the dirty bit to FALSE when you mark a PTE for the victim page as invalid.
	-->

      <p></p>
      <li> When running multiple processes, the page replacement
	algorithm may select a victim page to evict from another
	process.  As a result, you will need to update the
	TranslationEntry in the page table for <i>that</i> process,
	not the faulting one. </li>

      <p></p>
      <li> <tt>readVirtualMemory</tt> and <tt>writeVirtualMemory</tt>
	will need to pin memory.  It is possible that a process needs
	a page, but not only are all pages in use (meaning an eviction
	must occur), but all pages are pinned (meaning an eviction
	must not occur <i>now</i> ).  Handle this situation using
	synchronization.  If process A needs to evict a page, but all
	pages are pinned, block A.  When another process unpins a
	page, it can unblock A.  In terms of prioritizing, implement
	this functionality towards the end after you have general page
	replacement working.  </li>
      
    </ul>

  <p> Finally, you should only do as many page reads and writes as
    necessary to execute the program, and as dictated by the page
    replacement algorithm.  You will soon discover that the first page
    fault is different than subsequent ones on a particular page.  As
    described above, on the first fault on a page you need to read
    from the executable file, and on the second you may need to read
    from swap.  Your implementation needs to be able to
    handle this situation.  In short:  </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Read-only <tt>COFF</tt> sections originate in
    the <tt>COFF</tt> file, and should never appear in swap. </li>

    <li>Read/write <tt>COFF</tt> sections originate in
    the <tt>COFF</tt> file, but may need to enter swap if
    modified. </li>

    <li>Other pages should be zero-initialized, and are never read
    from the <tt>COFF</tt> file. </li>

  </ul>
    
    <!-- It might be tempting to just copy the pages from the
    executable file to the backing store when the process is first
    created, or on a page-by-page basis when the first fault occurs,
    but both of these cases introduce extra unecessary disk I/Os and
    should not be used. -->

<a name="tips"></a>
<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Read Ryan Huang's <a href="project3_guide.txt">tips</a> for project 3.

    <p></p>
  <li> There are many potential race conditions in this project
    because multiple processes are accessing shared data structures.
    We suggest using a coarse-grained lock to protect the data
    structures.  This will only be necessary once you start working
    with multiple processes, and do not worry about it until after you
    have page replacement working with a single process whose virtual
    address space exceeds physical memory.  </li>

    <p></p>
  <li> Occasionally check to make sure that you can still run project
    2 from the <tt>proj2</tt> subdirectory. </li>

</ol>

</ul>

<a name="testing"></a>
<h2>Testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Here are a couple of example test programs you can use to get
    started on testing your implementation:

    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="swap4.c">swap4.c</a>: Initialize and read a large array </li>
      <li> <a href="swap5.c">swap5.c</a>: Initialize, read, and modify a large array </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p></p>
  <li> Begin testing with a running program that does not
    use <tt>exec</tt>.  When you start implementing swapping, you can
    control the number of pages (and thus, indirectly, the necessity
    to swap) with the <tt>-m</tt> paramater to <tt>nachos</tt>:

    <pre> % nachos -m 8 -x swap4.coff </pre>
    

    or by modifying <tt>nachos.conf</tt> in
    the <tt>proj3</tt> subdirectory.  Your implementation should not
    depend upon any particular number of physical pages, but we will
    always test with at least four physical pages. </li>

    <p></p>
  <li> Implement a method to print memory state, and use it liberally
    when hunting for errors.  <tt>Lib.debug()</tt>
    and <tt>Lib.assertTrue()</tt> will also continue to be helpful. </li>
  
</ul>

<!--
    
<h2>Autograder Submission:</h2>

<p>You can test your implementation before you submit a final version
  by using the autograder.  The autograder works similar to the submit
  script. There is a project specific autograder submission script. To
  submit, log into your course account and run:

  <code>prep cs120f</code>( If you are in Prof. Voelker's class,
  run <code>prep cs120e</code> instead) Then move into your nachos
  directory and run<code>autograder-proj3</code> After completing the
  autograder submission, your submitted implementation will be put in
  a queue to be autograded. Results will be emailed to you (The email
  system often gets clogged. So you may need to wait a few hours to
  receive the email). The autograder runs every hour. You can submit
  your code to the autograder as many times as you like. The
  autograder will run up until the project submission deadline.

  <div class="alert alert-error" style="margin-left:15px">
    <span class="label label-warning">Important</span>
    <p><font color="black">
        <b>Please note: project solutions submitted to the autograder
        do not constitute a project submission. If you fail to submit
        your project as per the instructions below, you will not
        receive a grade for the project.</b></font>
    </p>
  </div>

-->

<h2>Code Submission</h2>

<p> As with the earlier projects, you do not have to do anything
  special to submit your project.  We will use a snapshot of your
  Nachos implementation in your github repository as it exists at the
  deadline, and grade that version.  (Even if you have made changes to
  your repo after the deadline, that's ok, we will use a snapshot of
  your code at the deadline.) </p>

<p> As a final step, create a file named README in the proj3
  directory.  The README file should list the members of your group
  and provide a short description of what code you wrote, how well it
  worked, how you tested your code, and how each group member
  contributed to the project.  The goal is to make it easier for us to
  understand what you did as we grade your project in case there is a
  problem with your code, not to burden you with a lot more work.  Do
  not agonize over wording.  It does not have to be poetic, but it
  should be informative. </p>


<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p> You can discuss concepts with students in other groups, but do not
  cheat when implementing your project.  Cheating includes copying
  code from someone else's implementation, or copying code from an
  implementation found on the Internet.  See the
  <a href="./index.html#cheating">main project page</a> for more
  information.

<p> We will manually check and also run code plagiarism tools on
  submissions and multiple Internet distributions (if you can find it,
  so can we).
