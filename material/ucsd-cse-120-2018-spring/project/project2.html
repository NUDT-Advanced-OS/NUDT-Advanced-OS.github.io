<h1>Project 2: Multiprogramming</h1>
<div class="h1sub">Spring 2018</div>

<p> The second Nachos project is to implement system calls and support
 multiprogramming.  As in the first project, we give you some of the
 code you need and your task is to complete the system and enhance it.
 Up to now, all the code you have written for Nachos has been part of
 the operating system kernel.  In a real operating system, the kernel
 not only uses its procedures internally, but allows user-level
 programs to access some of its routines via <i>system calls</i>.  The
 goal of this project is to enable user-level programs to invoke
 Nachos routines that you implement in the Nachos kernel.

<br><strong>Due</strong>: <span class="due">Saturday, May 19 at 11:59pm</span>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p> The changes you make to Nachos will be in these two files in
the <tt>userprog</tt> directory:

<ul>
<li><tt>UserKernel.java</tt> - a multiprogramming kernel.
<li><tt>UserProcess.java</tt> - a user process; manages the address
  space, and loads a program into virtual memory.
</ul>

You will also want to familiarize yourself with the other classes
in <tt>userprog</tt>:

<ul>
<li><tt>UThread.java</tt> - a thread capable of executing user MIPS code.
<li><tt>SynchConsole.java</tt> - a synchronized console; makes it
        possible to share the machine's serial console among multiple
        threads.
</ul>

<p> as well as a couple of classes in the <tt>machine</tt> directory:

<ul>
<li><tt>Processor</tt> simulates a MIPS processor.
<!--
<li><tt>SerialConsole</tt> simulates a serial console (for keyboard
        input and text output).
-->
<li><tt>FileSystem</tt> is a file system interface. To access files,
        use the <tt>FileSystem</tt> returned
        by <tt>Machine.stubFileSystem()</tt>. This file system
        accesses files in the <tt>test</tt> directory.
</ul>

<p> Nachos emulates user programs executing on a real CPU (a MIPS
R3000 chip).  By emulating execution, Nachos has complete control over
how many instructions are executed at a time, how the address
translation works, and how interrupts and exceptions (including system
calls) are handled.  The emulator can run normal programs compiled
from C to the MIPS instruction set.  The only caveat is that floating
point operations are not supported.

<p> Nachos initially is only able to run a single user-level MIPS
  program at a time, and supports one system call
  fully: <tt>halt</tt>.  All <tt>halt</tt> does is ask the operating
  system to shut the machine down.  This test program is found
  in <tt>test/halt.c</tt> and represents the simplest supported MIPS
  program.

<p> Nachos provides several other example MIPS programs in
the <tt>test</tt> directory.  You can use these programs to test your
implementation, and you will be writing new test programs of your own.
Of course, you will not be able to run the programs which make use of
features such as I/O until you implement the appropriate kernel
support.  That will be your task in this project.

<p> To compile the test programs, you need a MIPS cross-compiler.
This cross-compiler is already installed on the instructional machines
as <tt>mips-gcc</tt> (see the <tt>Makefile</tt> in the
<tt>test</tt> directory for details).  When logged into an
instructional machine, <tt>prep</tt> will initialize two environment
variables (ARCHDIR and PATH) to enable you to use the cross-compiler.

If you would like to use the cross-compiler on your own Linux machine
(or Linux virtual machine), you can download
the <a href="crosscompile.html">distribution</a> to your system.
Alternatively, you can compile your test programs on <tt>ieng6</tt>
and copy them over to your own machine.

<p> The <tt>test</tt> directory includes C source files (<tt>.c</tt>
files) and Nachos user program binaries (<tt>.coff</tt> files).  The
binaries can be created while in the <tt>test</tt> directory by
running <tt>make</tt>, or from the <tt>proj2</tt> directory by
running <tt>make test</tt>.

<p> You can run test programs by running <code>nachos -x
PROGNAME.coff</code> where <tt>PROGNAME.coff</tt> is the name of the
MIPS program binary in the <tt>test</tt> directory.  You will be
creating many test programs both for this project and project 3, and
you will place them all in the <tt>test</tt> directory.  To compile
your own test programs, add them to the <tt>Makefile</tt> in
the <tt>test</tt> directory in the line:

<pre>TARGETS = halt sh matmalt sort echo cat cp mv rm</pre>

and then run <tt>make</tt>.

</div>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<ol notype=I start=0>

  <li> (0%) Run your first Nachos user-level program.  Make sure you
    have run prep if necessary:

<blockquote><pre>
    % prep cs120s
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Go to the <tt>test</tt> directory and run <tt>make</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
    % cd nachos/test
    % make
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Then go to the <tt>proj2</tt> directory, run <tt>make</tt>, and
run <tt>nachos -x halt.coff</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
    % cd ../proj2
    % make
    % nachos -x halt.coff
</pre></blockquote>

<p> After typing 'q' at the prompt, Nachos will shutdown ("Machine
halting!").  To give you more insight into what happens as the user
program gets loaded, runs, and invokes a system call, next
run <tt>nachos -d ma -x halt.coff</tt>.  The <tt>'m'</tt> debug flag
enables MIPS disassembly, showing the instructions of the user-level
program being emulated on the CPU, and the <tt>'a'</tt> debug flag
prints process loading information.

<blockquote><pre>
    % nachos -d ma -x halt.coff
</pre></blockquote>
  
<p> Note that the baseline Nachos implementation has code in
UserKernel.selfTest() that tests the console device.  Nachos executes
this code every time it runs.  When you start testing your
implementation, you can comment out this code so that you do not have
to type 'q' every time you run Nachos.

<p>
<li> (35%) Implement the file system calls <tt>creat</tt>,
     <tt>open</tt>, <tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt>, <tt>close</tt>,
     and <tt>unlink</tt>.  Their semantics and specifications are
     documented in <tt>test/syscall.h</tt>.  You will see the code
     for <tt>halt</tt> and skeleton code for <tt>exit</tt> in
     <tt>UserProcess.java</tt>.  Implement the other system calls
     following the same pattern.  Note that you are <i>not</i>
     implementing a file system.  Rather, you are simply giving user
     processes the ability to access a file system that Nachos already
     implements. </p>

     <p> For further suggestions and tips, see
     the <a href="#tips">Tips</a> section below.  For examples and
     strategies for testing, see the
     <a href="#testing">Testing</a> section below. </p>


<ul type=disc>

<p>
<li> Nachos already provides the assembly code necessary for
     user-level programs to invoke system calls
     (see <tt>test/start.s</tt>; the <tt>SYSCALLSTUB</tt> macro
     generates assembly code for each syscall).

<p>
<li> When implementing the system calls, you will need
     to "bullet-proof" the Nachos kernel from user program
     errors.  There should be nothing a user program can do to crash
     the operating system (with the exception of explicitly invoking
     the <tt>halt</tt> syscall).  In other words, you must be sure
     that user programs do not pass bad arguments to the kernel (e.g.,
     a NULL pointer value of 0x0, or an invalid address) that cause
     the kernel to crash or corrupt its internal state or that of
     other processes.

<p>
<li> To handle large <tt>read</tt>/<tt>write</tt> calls, you should
     use a page-sized buffer to pass data between the file and user
     memory.

<p>
<li> Since the memory addresses passed as arguments to the system
     calls are virtual addresses, you need to use
     <tt>UserProcess.readVirtualMemory</tt> and
     <tt>UserProcess.writeVirtualMemory</tt> to transfer data between
     the user process and the kernel. 

<p>
<li> User processes store filenames and other string arguments as
     null-terminated strings in their virtual address space. The
     maximum length for strings passed as arguments to system calls is
     256 bytes (not including the terminating null).

<p>
  <li> System calls should return the appropriate value as documented
  in <tt>test/syscall.h</tt>.  When a system call needs to indicate an
  error condition to the user, it should return -1.  In particular, it
  should not assert or otherwise thrown an exception.

<p>
<li> When any process is started, its file descriptors 0 and 1 must
     refer to standard input and standard output.
     Use <tt>UserKernel.console.openForReading()</tt>
     and <tt>UserKernel.console.openForWriting()</tt> to implement
     these semantics. A user process <i>is</i> allowed to close these
     descriptors, just like descriptors returned by <tt>open</tt>.

<p>
<li> A stub file system interface to the UNIX file system is already
     provided for you, and the interface is implemented by the class
     <tt>machine/FileSystem.java</tt>.  You can access the stub
     filesystem through the static
     field <tt>ThreadedKernel.fileSystem</tt>. (Note that
     since <tt>UserKernel</tt> extends <tt>ThreadedKernel</tt>, you
     can still access this field.)  This filesystem is capable of
     accessing the <tt>test</tt> directory in Nachos, which is going
     to be useful when you implement the <tt>exec</tt> system call
     described below.  You do not need to implement any file system
     functionality, but you should examine carefully the
     specifications for <tt>FileSystem</tt> and
     <tt>StubFileSystem</tt> to determine what functionality you need
     to implement, and what is handled by the file system.

<p>
<li> Do not implement any kind of file locking, the file system is
     responsible for it.  If <tt>ThreadedKernel.fileSystem.open()</tt>
     returns a non-null <tt>OpenFile</tt>, then the user process is
     allowed to access the given file; otherwise, you should return an
     error.  Likewise, you do not need to worry about the details of
     what happens if multiple processes attempt to access the same
     file at once; the stub filesystem handles these details for you.

<p>
  <li> Each file that a process opens should have a unique <em>file
    descriptor</em> associated with it (see <tt>syscall.h</tt> for
    details).  The file descriptor should be a non-negative integer
    that is simply used to index into a table of currently-open files
    by that process.  Your implementation should have a file table
    size of 16, supporting up to 16 concurrently open files per
    process.  Note that a given file descriptor can be reused if the
    file associated with it is closed, and that different processes
    can use the same file descriptor value to refer to different files
    (e.g., in every process file descriptor 0 refers to stdin).

</ul>

<p>
<li> (30%) Implement support for multiprogramming.  The initial Nachos
  code is restricted to running only one user process, and your task
  is to make it work for multiple user processes.

  For further suggestions, see the <a href="#tips">Tips</a> section
  below.  For examples and strategies for testing, see the
  <a href="#testing">Testing</a> section below. </p>

<ul type=disc>

<p>
<li> 

<p> You will need to manage the allocation of pages of physical memory
so that different processes do not overlap in their memory usage.  You
can use whatever data structure you like to manage physical pages, but
we suggest maintaining a static linked list of free physical pages
(perhaps as part of the <tt>UserKernel</tt> class).  Be sure to use
synchronization where necessary when accessing this list to prevent
race conditions.

<p> Your solution must make <i>efficient</i> use of memory by
allocating pages for a new process wherever possible.  This means that
it is not acceptable to only allocate pages in a contiguous
block; your implementation must be able to make use of "gaps" in the
free memory pool.

<p>
<li>

<p> You will create and initialize the <tt>pageTable</tt> data
structure for each user process, which maps the process's virtual
addresses to physical addresses.  The <tt>TranslationEntry</tt> class
represents a single virtual-to-physical page translation.  The
field <tt>TranslationEntry.readOnly</tt> should be set to
<tt>true</tt> if the page is coming from a COFF section which is
marked as read-only.  You can determine this status using the method
<tt>CoffSection.isReadOnly()</tt>.

<p> Modify <tt>UserProcess.loadSections()</tt> so that it allocates
the number of physical pages that it needs (that is, based on the size
of the address space required to load and run the user program).  This
method is the one that should set up the <tt>pageTable</tt> structure
for the process so that the program is loaded into the physical memory
pages it has allocated for the address space.  
Note that user programs do not make use of <tt>malloc</tt> or
<tt>free</tt>, meaning that user programs effectively have no dynamic
memory allocation (and therefore, no heap).  The stack is fixed
size as well.  As a result, Nachos knows how many virtual pages a new
process needs for its address space when it is created.  If the new
user process cannot allocate sufficient physical pages for its address
space, <tt>exec</tt> should return an error.

<p> All of a process's memory should be freed on exit (whether it
exits normally, via the syscall <tt>exit</tt>, or abnormally, due to
an illegal operation).  As a result, its physical pages can be
subsequently reused by future processes.

<p>
<li>

<p> Modify <tt>UserProcess.readVirtualMemory</tt> and
<tt>UserProcess.writeVirtualMemory</tt>, which copy data between the
kernel and the user's virtual address space, so that they work with
multiple user processes.  Note that these methods should not throw
exceptions if they encounter an error when copying data; instead, they
must always return the number of bytes transferred (even if that
number is zero).

<p> The physical memory of the MIPS machine is accessed through the
method <tt>Machine.processor().getMemory()</tt>, and the total number
of physical pages is <tt>Machine.processor().getNumPhysPages()</tt>.


<li> The user threads (see the <tt>UThread</tt> class) already save
     and restore user machine state, as well as process state, on
     context switches.  So you are not responsible for these details.

</ul>

<p>
<li> (35%) Implement the system calls <tt>exec</tt>, <tt>join</tt>,
  and <tt>exit</tt>, also documented in <tt>syscall.h</tt>.

  For further suggestions, see the <a href="#tips">Tips</a> section
  below.  For examples and strategies for testing, see the
  <a href="#testing">Testing</a> section below. </p>

<p>
<ul type=disc>

<li> Note that, although Nachos chose the name <tt>exec</tt> for its
  system call, it is not the same as the Unix exec system call.  As
  described in <tt>syscall.h</tt>, the Nachos <tt>exec</tt> system
  call both creates a new process and loads a new program into that
  process.  (As a result, it essentially combines <tt>fork/exec</tt>
  on Unix and is similar to <tt>CreateProcess</tt> on Windows.)

  <p>  
<li> As with the other system calls, the addresses passed in registers
as arguments to <tt>exec</tt> and <tt>join</tt> are virtual addresses.
Use the methods <tt>readVirtualMemory</tt>
and <tt>readVirtualMemoryString</tt> to transfer data between kernel
memory and the memory of the user process.

<p>
  <li> Also bullet-proof these syscalls (e.g., handle cases such as
    the program passing a NULL pointer value of 0x0, or an invalid
    address, as the file name to <tt>exec</tt>).

<p>
<li> Note that the memory of the child process is entirely private to
this process.  This means that the parent and child do not directly
share memory or file descriptors.  Note that two processes can of
course open the same file; for example, all processes should have file
descriptors 0 and 1 mapped to the system console, as described above.

<p>
<li>Unlike <tt>KThread.join()</tt>, only a process's parent can join
to it.  For instance, if A executes B and B executes C, A is not
allowed to join to C, but B <i>is</i> allowed to join to C.

<p>
<li><tt>join</tt> takes a <em>process ID</em> as an argument, which is
used to uniquely identify the child process which the parent wishes to
join with.  The process ID should be a <i>globally unique positive
integer</i>, assigned to each process when it is created. (Although
for this project the only use of the process ID is in <tt>join</tt>,
for project 3 it is important that the process ID is unique across all
running processes in the system.) The easiest way of accomplishing
this is to maintain a static counter which indicates the next process
ID to assign.  Since the process ID is an <tt>int</tt>, then it may be
possible for this value to overflow if there are many processes in the
system. For this project you are not expected to deal with this case;
that is, assume that the process ID counter will not overflow.

<p>
<li> Extend the implementation of the <tt>halt</tt> system call so
that it can only be invoked by the "root" process &mdash; that is, the
first process in the system. If another process attempts to
invoke <tt>halt</tt>, the system call should be ignored and return
immediately.

<p>
<li>When a process calls <tt>exit</tt>, its thread should be
terminated and the process should clean up any state associated with
it (i.e., free up memory, close open files, etc.). Perform the same
cleanup if a process exits abnormally (e.g., executes an illegal
instruction).

<p>
<li> If a parent process has called <tt>join</tt> on a child process,
and the child process exits normally, then <tt>join</tt> needs to
transfer the child's exit status value to the parent.  A child process
exits normally if it calls the <tt>exit</tt> system call and provides
a status value as an argument.  If a child process terminates
abnormally (e.g., due to an unhandled exception), it will not have an
exit status.  In this case, <tt>join</tt> will return 0 to the parent
and the value of the <tt>status</tt> parameter does not need to be set
(see <tt>test/syscall.h</tt> for the complete specification).

<p>
<li> The last process to call <tt>exit</tt> should cause the machine
to halt by calling <tt>Kernel.kernel.terminate()</tt>. (Note that only
the root process should be allowed to invoke the <tt>halt</tt> system
call, but the last exiting process should call
<tt>Kernel.kernel.terminate()</tt> directly.)

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p> Here are some guidelines and tips for project 2 from previous CSE
  120 TAs: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Ryan Huang's <a href="project2_guide.txt">tips</a>
  <li> Matus Telgarsky's <a href="p2.tips">tips</a>
</ul>

<a name="testing"></a>
<h2>Testing</h2>

<p> As with all of the projects, it is your responsibility to
  implement your own tests to thoroughly exercise your code to ensure
  that it meets the requirements specified for each part of the
  project.  Testing is an important skill to develop, and the Nachos
  projects will help you to continue to develop that skill.  In this
  project, you will implement tests as user-level programs written in
  C.  See the discussion at the top of this page on creating test
  programs in the <tt>test</tt> directory, compiling them, and running
  them with Nachos.

<p> The following pages provide testing strategies and example test
  programs for the project:

<ul>
  <li><a href="syscall-testing.html">File system calls</a>
  <li><a href="multi-testing.html">Multiprogramming support</a>
  <li><a href="exec-testing.html">Multiple processes</a>
</ul>

<h2>Autograder</h2>

<p>  You can test your implementation before you submit a final version by using the autograder. The autograder works similar to the submit script. There is a project specific autograder submission script. To submit, log into your course account and run: 
        <code>prep cs120f</code> (If you are in Prof. Voelker's class, run <code>prep cs120e</code> instead).

Then move into your <tt>nachos</tt> directory and
run <code>autograder-proj2</code>.  After completing the autograder
submission, your submitted implementation will be put in a queue to be
autograded.  Results will be emailed to you; note that the email system often
gets clogged, so you may need to wait to receive the email).
The autograder runs every hour.  You can submit your code to
the autograder as many times as you like. The autograder will run up
until the project submission deadline.

<div class="alert alert-error" style="margin-left:15px">
<span class="label label-warning">Important</span>

<p> <b>Please note: project solutions submitted to the autograder do
not constitute a project submission. If you fail to submit your
project as per the instructions below, you will not receive a grade
for the project.</b>

</div>
</div>
-->

<h2>Code Submission</h2>

<p> As with the first project, you do not have to do anything special
  to submit your project.  We will use a snapshot of your Nachos
  implementation in your github repository as it exists at the
  deadline, and grade that version.  (Even if you have made changes to
  your repo after the deadline, that's ok, we will use a snapshot of
  your code at the deadline.) </p>

<p> As a final step, create a file named README in the proj2
  directory.  The README file should list the members of your group
  and provide a short description of what code you wrote, how well it
  worked, how you tested your code, and how each group member
  contributed to the project.  The goal is to make it easier for us to
  understand what you did as we grade your project in case there is a
  problem with your code, not to burden you with a lot more work.  Do
  not agonize over wording.  It does not have to be poetic, but it
  should be informative. </p>

<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p> You can discuss concepts with students in other groups, but do not
  cheat when implementing your project.  Cheating includes copying
  code from someone else's implementation, or copying code from an
  implementation found on the Internet.  See the
  <a href="./index.html#cheating">main project page</a> for more
  information.

<p> We will manually check and also run code plagiarism tools on
  submissions and multiple Internet distributions (if you can find it,
  so can we).
