<p> The baseline Nachos implementation has an incomplete thread
system.  In this project, your job is to complete it, and then use it
to solve synchronization problems.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p> Properly synchronized code should work no matter what order the
scheduler chooses to run the threads on the ready list. In other
words, we should be able to put a call to <tt>KThread.yield</tt>
(causing the scheduler to choose another thread to run) anywhere in
your code where interrupts are enabled, and your code should still be
correct.  You will be asked to write properly synchronized code as
part of the later assignments, so understanding how to do this is
crucial to being able to do the project.

<p> To aid you in this, code linked in with Nachos will cause
<tt>KThread.yield</tt> to be called on your behalf in a repeatable
(but sometimes unpredictable) way.  Nachos code is repeatable in that
if you call it repeatedly with the same arguments, it will do exactly
the same thing each time.  However, if you invoke <tt>nachos
-s <i>&lt;number&gt;</i></tt> with a different <tt>number</tt> each
time, calls to <tt>KThread.yield</tt> will be inserted at different
places in the code.

<p> You will be modifying source code files in the <tt>threads</tt>
  subdirectory, and compiling in the <tt>proj1</tt> subdirectory.  You
  can add new classes to your project as you see fit; the code we
  provide you is a skeleton for the project.  As described on
  the <a href="./index.html#project-source">main project page</a>,
  though, be careful to only add any additional classes to the
  packages (directories) permitted.

<p> There should be no busy-waiting in any of your solutions to this
  assignment.  (The initial implementation of <tt>Alarm.waitUntil</tt>
  is an example of busy-waiting.)
  
<h2>Tasks</h2>

<ol start=0>

<p>
  <li> (0%) Be sure to have your group registered on the Google form
  so that we can create a course repo on github for you (see the
  pinned Piazza note).  This step applies even if you are working on
  your own.  We can only grade repos that were created for the course.

    <p> Browse through the initial thread system implementation,
    starting with <tt>KThread.java</tt>.  This thread system
    implements thread fork, thread completion, and semaphores for
    synchronization.  It also provides locks and condition variables
    built on top of semaphores.

  <p> Trace the execution path (by hand) for the startup test case
  provided.  When you trace the execution path, it is helpful to keep
  track of the state of each thread and which procedures are on each
  thread's execution stack.  You will notice that when one thread
  calls <tt>TCB.contextSwitch</tt>, that thread stops executing, and
  another thread starts running.  The first thing the new thread does
  is to return from <tt>TCB.contextSwitch</tt>.  We realize this will
  seem cryptic to you at first, but you will understand threads once
  you understand why the <tt>TCB.contextSwitch</tt> that gets called
  is different from the <tt>TCB.contextSwitch</tt> that returns.

  <p> Compile and run the baseline implementation of Nachos in
    the <tt>proj1</tt> directory:

<blockquote><pre>
    % cd nachos/proj1
    % make
    % nachos
</pre></blockquote>

  <p> The output should be the same as in project 0 before your changes.

<p>
<li>(20%) Complete the implementation of the <tt>Alarm</tt> class.  A
  thread calls <tt>waitUntil(long x)</tt> to suspend its execution
  until wall-clock time has advanced to at least <i>now</i>
  + <i>x</i>.  This method is useful for threads that operate in real
  time, such as blinking the cursor once per second.  There is no
  requirement that threads start running immediately after waking up;
  just put them on the ready queue in the timer interrupt handler
  after they have waited for at least the right amount of time.  Do
  not fork any additional threads to implement <tt>waitUntil</tt>; you
  need only modify <tt>waitUntil</tt> and the timer interrupt handler
  methods. <tt>waitUntil</tt> itself, though, is not limited to being
  called by one thread; any number of threads may call it and be
  suspended at any one time.

  If the wait parameter <tt>x</tt> is 0 or negative, return without
  waiting (do not assert).

  <p> Note that only one instance of <tt>Alarm</tt> may exist at a time
  (due to a limitation of Nachos), and Nachos already creates one
  global alarm that is referenced via <tt>ThreadedKernel.alarm</tt>.

  <!--
  <p>
  <div class="task-error">Error handling</div>
  <p>
-->

  <p><b>Testing:</b> Implement tests that verify that a thread waits
  (approximately) for its requested duration; if the wait parameter is
  0 or negative, the thread does not wait; multiple threads waiting on
  the alarm are woken up at the proper times, and in the proper order.

  For examples and strategies for implementing tests, see the
  <a href="#testing">Testing</a> section below.
  
<p>
<li>(20%) Implement <tt>KThread.join</tt>, which synchronizes the
  <i>calling</i> thread with the completion of the <i>called</i>
  thread.  As an example, if thread <tt>B</tt> executes the following:

<blockquote><pre>
    KThread A = new KThread (...);
    ...
    A.join ();
</pre></blockquote>

  we say that thread <tt>B</tt> (the "parent") joins with
  thread <tt>A</tt> (the "child").

<!--
  <p>
  <div class="task-spec">Specification</div>
-->

  When <tt>B</tt> calls join on <tt>A</tt>, there are two
  possibilities.  If <tt>A</tt>has already finished, then <tt>B</tt>
  returns immediately from join without waiting.  If <tt>A</tt> has
  not finished, then <tt>B</tt> waits inside of join until <tt>A</tt>
  finishes; when <tt>A</tt> finishes, it resumes <tt>B</tt>.

  <p> Note that join does not have to be called on a thread.  A thread
  should be able to finish successfully even if no other thread calls
  join on it.

    <!--
  <div class="task-error">Error handling</div>
  -->
    
  <p> A thread cannot join to itself.  (The initial implementation
    already checks for this case and invokes Lib.assert when it
    happens.  Keep this Lib.assert call in your code.)

  <p> Join can be called on a thread at most once.  If
  thread <tt>B</tt> calls join on <tt>A</tt>, then it is an error
  for <tt>B</tt> or any other thread <tt>C</tt> to call join
  on <tt>A</tt> again.  Assert on this error.

  <p><b>Testing:</b> Implement tests that verify if a parent
  calls join on a child and the child is still executing, the parent
  waits; if a parent calls join on a child and the child has finished
  executing, the parent does not block; if a thread calls join on
  itself, Nachos asserts; if join is called more than once on a
  thread, Nachos asserts; one parent thread can join with multiple
  child threads in succession; independent pairs of parent/child
  threads can join with each other without interference.
  
<!--  
 Note that another thread
  does not have to call <tt>join</tt>, but if it is called, it must
  be called only once. The result of calling
 <tt>join</tt> a second time on the same thread is undefined, even
 if the second caller is a different thread than the first
 caller. Said another way: there is no requirement to support multiple
 join calls on the same thread. For example, say threads A, B & C
 exist and all have references to each other. If A calls <tt>B.join()</tt> then
 you do not need to support the case where C also calls <tt>B.join()</tt>.  A
 thread must finish executing normally whether or not it is joined.
-->

<p>
<li>(30%) Implement condition variables using interrupt enable and
  disable to provide atomicity.  The class <tt>Condition</tt> is a
  sample implementation that uses semaphores, and your job is to
  provide an equivalent implementation in class <tt>Condition2</tt> by
  manipulating interrupts instead of using semaphores.  Once you are
  done, you will have two alternative implementations that provide the
  exact same functionality.  Examine the existing implementation of
  class <tt>Semaphore</tt> to guide you on how to manipulate
  interrupts for when you implement the methods
  of <tt>Condition2</tt>.

  <!--
  <p>
  <div class="task-error">Error handling</div>
  -->
  
  <p> A thread must have acquired the lock associated with the
  condition variable when it invokes methods on the CV.  The
  underlying implementation of the <tt>Lock</tt> class already has
  code to assert in these cases, but we recommend writing a test
  program that causes such an error so that you can see what happens.

  <p><b>Testing:</b> Implement tests that verify that <tt>sleep</tt>
  blocks the calling thread; <tt>wake</tt> wakes up at most one
  thread, even if multiple threads are waiting; <tt>wakeAll</tt> wakes
  up all waiting threads; if a thread calls any of the synchronization
  methods without holding the lock, Nachos asserts; <tt>wake</tt> and
  <tt>wakeAll</tt> with no waiting threads have no effect, yet future
  threads that <tt>sleep</tt> will still block (i.e.,
  the <tt>wake/wakeAll</tt> is "lost", which is in contrast to the
  semantics of semaphores).

    <!--
    deleting a lock or condition
    variable should have no threads on the wait queue.
      -->
<p>
<li>(30%) An online MOBA game company would like your assistance.
  They would like you to implement a game matching class that groups
  together players of the same ability into fixed-sized groups to play
  matches with each other.  Your task is to implement the
  class <tt>GameMatch</tt> using <tt>Lock</tt> and <tt>Condition</tt>
  to synchronize player threads into groups.  A <tt>GameMatch</tt> is
  created specifying the number of players <tt>N</tt> required for a
  game match.  You may assume that <tt>N</tt> will always be greater
  than <tt>0</tt>.

<p> Each player is a separate thread that invokes the <tt>play</tt>
  method to join a match with a parameter indicating their ability
  level.  The parameter <tt>ability</tt> can have one of three
  values: <tt>abilityBeginner</tt>, <tt>abilityIntermediate</tt>,
  and <tt>abilityExpert</tt>.  <tt>play</tt> blocks a calling thread
  until <tt>N</tt> player threads of the <i>same</i> <tt>ability</tt>
  have called <tt>play</tt>.  At that point, all threads of that
  ability waiting for a match should continue and return
  from <tt>play</tt> (but not threads of other abilities).  Subsequent
  threads of that ability calling <tt>play</tt> will then wait to form
  a group for the next match.  <tt>play</tt> returns <tt>-1</tt> if it
  is invoked with an unknown ability.

<p> The return value of <tt>play</tt> is the match number.  The first
  match returned by <tt>play</tt> has match number <tt>1</tt>, and
  every subsequent match returned by <tt>play</tt> increments the
  match number by one, independent of ability.  No two matches should
  have the same match number, match numbers should be strictly
  monotonically increasing, and there should be no gaps between match
  numbers.  Different instances of a <tt>GameMatch</tt> have their own
  independent match number history.

<p> Tip: Implement <tt>GameMatch</tt> in stages.  First implement
  correct synchronization behavior for one ability, ignoring tracking
  match numbers.  Then extend your implementation to handle all
  abilities.  Then track match numbers.

<p><b>Testing:</b> Implement tests that verify that <tt>play</tt> only
  returns when <tt>N</tt> threads of the same ability have called
  it; <tt>play</tt> can create matches of threads with different
  abilities; threads do not return from <tt>play</tt> unless they are
  matched; multiple <tt>GameMatch</tt> instances do not interfere with
  each other; <tt>play</tt> returns match numbers as specified;
  <tt>play</tt> returns an error if invoked with an unknown ability.
  
<!--    
<p>
<li>(30%) Implement the <tt>Communicator</tt> class to perform
synchronous send and receive of one word messages (also known as
Ada-style rendezvous).  Synchronize threads calling
the methods
<tt>void speak(int word)</tt> and <tt>int listen()</tt> using
condition variables.  

A thread calling <tt>speak</tt> atomically waits until a different
thread calls <tt>listen</tt> on the same <tt>Communicator</tt> object,
facilitating the word parameter to be transfered between threads.
Once the transfer is made&mdash;and only once it is made&mdash;both
threads can return.  Similarly, a thread calling <tt>listen</tt> waits
until a different thread calls <tt>speak</tt>, at which point the
transfer is made, and both can return.  In both cases, <tt>listen</tt>
returns the word passed to <tt>speak</tt>.  After the transfer is
made, it does not matter the order in which either thread returns.

<p> Your implementation should work correctly even if there are
multiple <tt>speak</tt>ers and
<tt>listen</tt>ers for the same <tt>Communicator</tt> object.  In this
case, a message is still passed between one speaker and one
listener&mdash;the other threads are queued.  Listener and speaker
threads pair up in first-come-first-served order.  (Your
implementation cannot use a queue or list data structure to keep track
of the multiple threads or the multiple words passed in; condition variables have all the queues
needed.)

<p> To summarize:
<ul>
  <li>
  If a thread calls <tt>speak</tt>, and it is the only thread in the
  Communicator, it will block inside of <tt>speak</tt> until a
  different thread calls <tt>listen</tt>.

  <li>
  Similarly if a thread calls <tt>listen</tt>, and it is the only
  thread in the Communicator, it will block inside of <tt>listen</tt>
  until a different thread calls <tt>speak</tt>.

  <li>
  A thread that calls <tt>speak</tt> cannot return from <tt>speak</tt>
  until it knows that a thread has called <tt>listen</tt> and has
  received the word message.  (The analagous situation holds for
  threads that call <tt>listen</tt>.)

  <li>
  If multiple threads call <tt>speak</tt>, these threads will also
  block inside of <tt>speak</tt> until the first thread has finished.
  (The analagous situation holds for multiple <tt>listeners</tt>.)
</ul>

<p><b>Testing:</b> Implement tests that verify the semantics above: a
  speaker blocks until a listener has received the value (and
  vice-versa); if there are multiple speakers and listeners, they
  exchange values in FIFO order; if there are more speakers than
  listeners, the "extra" speakers block (and vice-versa); when there
  are multiple Communicator objects, the speakers and listeners for
  one object do not interact with the speakers and listeners for other
  objects.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p> It is your responsibility to implement your own tests to
  thoroughly exercise your code to ensure that it meets the
  requirements specified for each part of the project.  Testing is an
  important skill to develop, and the Nachos projects will help you to
  continue to develop that skill.  You can add calls to testing code
  in <tt>ThreadedKernel.selfTest</tt>, and add class-specific code in
  <tt>selfTest</tt> methods of each class.

<p> As a testing strategy, first start with simple tests and then
  implement more complicated tests.  When something goes wrong with a
  simple test, it is easier to pinpoint what aspect of your
  implementation has a bug.  When something goes wrong with a more
  complicated test, it is more difficult to determine where the bug
  may be unless you can rule out all the causes that your simple tests
  have shown to already be correct.  We also strongly recommend
  implementing tests as separate methods, rather than making changes
  to just one or a few methods.  Rather than making a change to an
  existing test to evaluate new functionality, copy the test into a
  new method and make the change.  That way, your earlier tests are
  always there in case you need to use them again.  You can comment
  out calls to previous tests so that you can concentrate on one test
  at a time.

<p> To help you get jumpstarted on testing, here are a handful of
  example test programs across the various problems:
  
  <ul>
    <li>A <a href="alarmTest1.java">simple test for Alarm</a>
    <li>A <a href="joinTest1.java">simple test for Join</a>
    <li>A <a href="intlockTest.java">simple test for Condition2</a>,
      and a <a href="cvTest5.java">more complicated test for Condition2</a>
    <li>A <a href="matchTest.java">simple test for GameMatch</a>
<!--      
    <li>A <a href="commTest6.java">more complicated test for Communicator</a>
-->
  </ul>

  
  <!--
<p> If you are not sure what you should be testing, go back to the
  problem specification.  For example, for <tt>KThread.join</tt>, you
  will want to test that if a parent calls join on a child and the
  child is still executing, the parent waits; if a parent calls join
  on a child and the child has finished executing, the parent does not
  block; if a thread calls join on itself, Nachos asserts; if join is
  called more than once on a thread, Nachos asserts; etc.
  -->
  
<!--  
<p> To also aid you in this effort, you can test your implementation
  before the deadline using the Nachos autograder (note that this
  autograder is different than the system for requesting help from TAs
  and tutors in the lab).  There is a project-specific autograder
  submission script.  In your nachos directory,
  run<code>autograder-proj1</code>:

  <blockquote><pre>
    % cd nachos
    % autograder-proj1
</pre></blockquote>

<p> After completing the autograder submission, your submitted
  implementation will be put in a queue to be autograded.  Results
  will be emailed to you.  The autograder runs every hour, so it may
  take some time before you receive a response.  You can submit your
  code to the autograder as many times as you like, and the autograder
  will run up until the project submission deadline.

<p> <b>Note:</b> The tests used in the autograder are <i>not</i> an
  exhaustive set of tests, they are just a sample set of tests.  You
  should first write your own tests to convince yourself that your
  implementation works correctly.  Then submit your code to the
  autograder.

<h2>Code Submission</h2>

<p> You do not have to do anything special to submit your project.  We
  will use a snapshot of your Nachos implementation in your github
  repository as it exists at the deadline, and grade that version.
  (Even if you have made changes to your repo after the deadline,
  that's ok, we will use a snapshot of your code at the deadline.)

<!--
  As with all projects you will submit it using the project specific
submission script. Only one submission per group is expected. To
submit, log into your course account and run: <code>prep cs120f</code>
( If you are in Prof. Voelker's class, run <code>prep cs120e</code>
instead ) Then move into your nachos directory and
run: <code>submit-proj1</code> You will have until the posted due date
to submit this project. You can submit as many times as you like. The
last version submitted before the due date will be the one accepted.
  -->

<h2>Cheating</h2>

<p> You can discuss concepts with students in other groups, but do not
  cheat when implementing your project.  Cheating includes copying
  code from someone else's implementation, or copying code from an
  implementation found on the Internet.  See the
  <a href="./index.html#cheating">main project page</a> for more
  information.

<p> We will manually check and also run code plagiarism tools on
  submissions and multiple Internet distributions (if you can find it,
  so can we).
